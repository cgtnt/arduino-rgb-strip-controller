# Arduino RGB LED Strip Controller
*Project Venera - UG Bozon - https://ugbozon.com/*

**Node.js Controller for Arduino RGB LED Strips**

# Setup:
- Run ``npm install`` to install node dependencies
- **/ArduinoSide/ArduinoSide.ino** - Change LED pin variables according to your Arduino wiring and upload to your Arduino board;
- **/clientSide/app.js - run this file with node;**
-**Console will open, do not close it until you are done using the controller - closing the console shuts down the local server communicating with the Arduino;**
